Place to share our code
Made this read me file to try to learn how to use Git Hub
So far I can see that I do not have permissions to create a branch off of PaulChoin master
I could only make a fork, so for now I will work in the fork
NOTE: The files in my fork do not update with the master, so I need to figure out how to 
change this.
